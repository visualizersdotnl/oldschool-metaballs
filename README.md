# oldschool-metaballs (originally for Pentium Celeron 733Mhz / Xbox)

I released this because for some of us the whole effect coding and the performance aspect of it was very much a part of demoscene culture I carried over from the 1990s mindset. I hope some enjoy seeing this workhorse implementation of mine and perhaps even admire the tinkering a much younger me did.

- Oldschool SIMD-optimized surface crawler (first version ~2001-2002).
- It's a snippet taken from TPB-06 (http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=64338) where I used them once more, without any further thread parallelism.
- It won't compile out of the box.

Have fun! :)
