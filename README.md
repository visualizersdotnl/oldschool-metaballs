I released this because it is a cute reminder of the demoscene 'effect performance optimization' ethos/race (that for me and many others stems from the 1990s). I hope some enjoy seeing this workhorse implementation of mine and perhaps even admire the tinkering a much younger me did.

- Oldschool SIMD-optimized surface crawler (first version ~2001-2002).
- It's a snippet taken from TPB-06 (http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=64338) where I used them once more, without any further thread parallelism.
- It won't compile out of the box.

Have fun! :)
