# oldschool-metaballs

09/01/2026 -- I've formed a plan to unabandon this by now very retro stuff, appropriate it for something or other, and parallelize it on CPU.

Oldschool optimized CPU metaballs implementation (surface crawler).  
It's a snippet taken from TPB-06 (http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=64338).

It won't compile out of the box, nor be updated.

Have fun! :)
