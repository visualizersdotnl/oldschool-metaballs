# oldschool-metaballs (originally for Pentium Celeron 733Mhz / Xbox)

- Oldschool SIMD-optimized surface crawler (first version ~2001-2002).
- It's a snippet taken from TPB-06 (http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=64338) where I used them once more, without any further thread parallelism.
- It won't compile out of the box.

Have fun! :)
